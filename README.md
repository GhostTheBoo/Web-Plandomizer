# Web-Plandomizer

## Description

An online version of my plandomizer tool!

A very rough work in progress so excuse the look for now while I'm still learning.

## Current implementations

Chests

Popups

Equipment

Levels

## How-To

Check all of the items you wish to replace, select what you wish to replace them with, and click replace.

Click Default to return the selected item to its vanilla state.

Click save to download a pnach file for the selected page.

Each page will delete your data when switching so be 100% sure you save before switching pages.
